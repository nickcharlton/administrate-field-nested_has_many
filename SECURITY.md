# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only expect to support the latest version of Administrate (and it's related
projects) as a given time. If you find a security issue with an older version,
please try updating to the latest version first.

If for some reason you can't update to the latest version, please let us know
your reasons so that we can have a better understanding of your situation.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For security inquiries or vulnerability reports, please email
<security@thoughtbot.com>.
If you'd like, you can use our PGP key when reporting vulnerabilities.
